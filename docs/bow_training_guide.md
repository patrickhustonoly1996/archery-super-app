# OLY Bow Training System - User Guide

A plain English guide to the bow training features in the Archery Super App.

---

## What Is This?

The OLY Bow Training System helps archers build the strength and endurance to hold a bow at full draw. It's a structured program that starts wherever you are and gradually increases the challenge as you get stronger.

The key innovation: you train with an **elbow sling** instead of your fingers on the string. This lets you build holding strength safely without risking bad habits in your string hand and the upstream mechanics.

---

## Two Ways to Train

### Elbow Sling Training (Recommended for Everyone)

You wear a strap that connects your elbow to the bow. Your fingertips can touch the string lightly, but they're not taking any load. This is how all the main training sessions work.

**Why this way?**
- Builds strength without stressing your fingers
- Can't develop bad string arm habits
- Lets you train at higher volumes safely

### Finger SPT (Advanced Only)

Traditional holding practice with fingers on the string. This section comes with a warning because:
- It can reinforce poor technique
- Only recommended if you have solid, consistent string hand form
- Best done after working with a coach on your hook

---

## How Sessions Work

Every training session is made up of:

1. **Hold** - Draw to full draw, hold for a set time
2. **Rest** - Let down, recover
3. **Repeat** - Do it again for a set number of times

For example, a beginner session might be:
- Hold for 10 seconds
- Rest for 25 seconds
- Do this 5 times

Sessions get progressively harder by:
- Increasing hold times (10s → 15s → 20s → 30s)
- Decreasing rest times
- Adding more sets
- Introducing movement exercises (not just static holds)

---

## The Levels Explained

Sessions are numbered from 0.3 up to 2.5 (and beyond). The number tells you roughly how hard it is:

| Level | What It Means | Typical Duration |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 0.3 | Complete beginner | ~3 minutes |
| 0.5-0.7 | Building basics | 5-10 minutes |
| 1.0 | Foundation level | ~15 minutes |
| 1.5 | Intermediate | ~16 minutes |
| 2.0 | Advanced (30 min sessions) | ~30 minutes |
| 2.5 | Expert with aimed work | ~30 minutes |

You don't have to follow these exactly. The app adapts to you.

## Starting Out

### The Assessment

Before you start, the app asks you to do a **max hold test**:
1. Warm up properly (this is mandatory and important)
2. Draw your bow and hold as long as you can while keeping good form
3. Tap when you let down

Based on how long you held, the app suggests a starting level. You can always choose a different level if you prefer.

**Safety First**: The warm-up isn't optional. Holding at full draw without warming up can cause injury and won't give accurate results anyway.

---

## After Each Session

The app asks you three simple questions (rate 1-10):

1. **How much were you shaking?**
   - 1 = rock solid
   - 10 = couldn't control it

2. **How well did you keep your form?**
   - 1 = perfect throughout
   - 10 = falling apart

3. **Did the rest feel long enough?**
   - 1 = too much rest
   - 10 = nowhere near enough

Your answers help the app decide whether to:
- **Move you up** (everything felt easy)
- **Keep you at the same level** (good training zone)
- **Suggest an easier session** (you're struggling)

---

## Moving Up and Down

### Progressing

The app suggests harder sessions when:
- You complete the full session
- Your feedback scores are low (meaning it felt comfortable)
- You've been consistent

### Regressing (and that's OK)

Sometimes you need to go easier. The app suggests this when:
- You couldn't finish the session
- Your form was breaking down
- You've missed sessions or had a break

**There's no shame in regression.** Life happens. The app adjusts. You can also manually say "make it easier" anytime.

---

## Different Session Types

### Normal Training Sessions
The bread and butter. Structured holds with rest periods. Progress through the levels over time.

### Endurance Sessions
Once you're comfortable with 20-second holds, the app suggests adding one endurance session per week. These are:
- Longer overall (20-30 minutes)
- More rest between holds
- About building stamina for competitions

### Light Bow Sessions
If you have a lighter "trainer" bow (say, 22 lbs instead of your 53 lb competition bow), you can do much longer sessions. The app lets you:
- Select which bow you're using
- Access higher-level sessions on your light bow
- Track these separately from your competition bow progress

---

## Using Multiple Bows

You can set up profiles for different bows:
- Competition bow (your main setup)
- Trainer bow (lighter weight for volume work)
- Others as needed

When you start a session, you pick which bow you're using. The app adjusts what sessions are available based on the bow's weight.

---

## Warm-up Routines

Three options built into the app:

**Quick (45 seconds)**
For when you're already warmed up from other training. Basic arm circles, shoulder shrugs, deep breaths.

**Standard (2.5 minutes)**
The everyday option. Adds band work, thoracic rotations, and light draws.

**Full (8 minutes)**
The complete routine. Band work, mobility, light draws progressing to reversals, and mental preparation.

---

## Technique Cues

During holds, the app can show you reminders like:
- "Shoulders/neck relaxed"
- "Keep your core engaged"
- "Balance the forces"

These appear on screen during the hold to help you focus on form. You can choose which cues you want to see (or turn them off).

---

## Building Your Own Sessions

Don't want to follow the preset sessions? Build your own:

1. Tap the + button to add blocks
2. Choose: warm-up, exercise, cool-down, or technique cue
3. Set the timing for each exercise
4. Drag to reorder
5. Save with a name

Your custom sessions appear in "My Sessions" sorted by how often you use them.

---

## The 26-Week Program

For those who want a structured plan, there's a 26-week guided program:
- 3 sessions per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- Built-in rest weeks every 4-6 weeks
- Progresses from Level 1.0 to Level 2.1+

The program adapts if you need to regress or take breaks. It's a guide, not a rigid schedule.

---

## Key Concepts

### Work Ratio
How much time holding vs resting. Higher ratio = harder session.
- Ratio of 0.5 = twice as much rest as work
- Ratio of 1.0 = equal work and rest
- Ratio of 1.2 = more work than rest

### Volume Load
A measure of total training stress. Combines hold time, bow weight, and exercise intensity. You don't need to think about this - it's tracked in the background.

### Intensity Multipliers
Different exercises are harder per second:
- Static hold = baseline (1.0)
- Movement exercises = harder (1.1-1.3)
- Aimed work = hardest (1.4+)

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Always warm up.** No exceptions.

2. **Listen to your body.** If form breaks down, stop. It's not worth reinforcing bad habits.

3. **Be honest in feedback.** The app can only help if you tell it the truth about how the session felt.

4. **Consistency beats intensity.** Three 10-minute sessions per week is better than one 30-minute session followed by a week off.

5. **Regression is normal.** After illness, holidays, or busy periods, expect to drop back a level or two. That's fine.

6. **Use your trainer bow.** If you have a light bow, use it for volume work. It's easier on your body while still building the movement patterns.

## Questions?

This system is based on Patrick Huston's training methods developed for Olympic-level archery. If something isn't clear or seems wrong for your situation, adjust accordingly. The app is a tool, not a coach - use your judgement.
