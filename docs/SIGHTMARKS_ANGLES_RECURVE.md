# Recurve Sight Angles Reference

## Chartres "Gain/Inclinaison" Chart

This document captures the key concepts from the Chartres sight angle diagram - a classic French recurve sighting reference tool.

### What the Chart Shows

The fan-shaped diagram maps the relationship between:
- **Distance** (15m → 60m, radiating outward from the apex)
- **Sight inclination** (vertical angle adjustment, shown as colored bands)
- **Angular position** (0° → ~50°, marked on the outer arc)

### Inclination Values by Distance

| Distance | Typical Inclination Range |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 15m      | +1 to 0                  |
| 30m      | 0 to -2                  |
| 45m      | -4 to -7                 |
| 60m      | -9 to -11                |

### Color Band Zones (top to bottom)

| Color        | Inclination | Notes                          |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Green (top)  | +1          | Short distance, minimal drop   |
| Blue bands   | 0 to -2     | Mid-short distances            |
| Green        | -1 to -2    | Transition zone                |
| Yellow       | -3 to -4    | Medium distance                |
| Pink/Magenta | -5 to -6    | Medium-long                    |
| Cyan         | -7 to -8    | Long distance                  |
| Orange/Tan   | -9 to -11   | Maximum distance (60m)         |

### Key Concept: "Gain"

The "Gain" in "Gain/Inclinaison" refers to the **rate of change** in sight position between distances. This is non-linear:

- **Short distances (15-30m)**: Small sight changes between distances
- **Long distances (45-60m)**: Larger sight changes between distances

This is why the colored bands get wider (more spread) as distance increases - each unit of inclination covers more angular range at longer distances.

### Practical Application

1. The chart helps visualize why your sight tape isn't evenly spaced
2. At close range, small distance errors = small vertical errors
3. At long range, small distance errors = larger vertical errors
4. Wind/elevation adjustments compound more at distance
